Use "javac" to compile each program

for example:

>javac encrypt.java
>

Once compiled use "java" followed by compiled executable ("encrypt" or "decrypt") 
followed by arguments. The arguments are as follows, name of input file, name
of output file and key.

An example of running an encryption on the file foo:

>java encrypt foo bar key
>

This command encrypts the file "foo" with the key "baz" and outputs the 
encrypted text into the file "bar".
