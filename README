Each directory contains an implementation of a program that performs encryption
on files in the directory name's language. For instance the directory "c++" 
contains the encryption program written in c++. Instructions for compiling and
running each program are contained in a README in each directory. 

In this directory are example files. You can simply copy them into the 
respective directories and see how the encryption and decryption works.

The encryption is performed using a vignere cipher accross every byte of a
file.
