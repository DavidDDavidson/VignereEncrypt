To run encryption on a file, use the "python3" command, followed by what you'd
like to perform (encryption or decryption), followed by name of input file,
name of output file, and key.

For example:

>python3 encrypt.py in out key
>

In this example, the file "in" is encrypted using the key "key" and the 
resulting encrypted data is written to the file "out".
